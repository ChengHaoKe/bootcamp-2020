# Introduction

_**[Software Carpentry session on the Unix shell](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)**_

## Today's goals

We have very limited time for a very big topic today, so rather than try to get you feeling totally comfortable working in the terminal, the goals for today are

1. Get everybody up to a baseline level of understanding of the shell
2. Get past the fear of breaking your computer by typing stuff into a terminal
3. Prepare you for the other boot camp sessions
4. Teach you the stuff that's hard to Google so that you'll find it easier to continue learning on your own

## What is a "shell?"

* A **shell** is a special program that receives text input on a command line, passes commands to other programs, prints their output back to the user (or somewhere else, if the user asks it to), and displays a prompt to signal that it's ready to receive a command.
* A **terminal** is a program that displays a shell to the user. The terminal handles things like displaying colors and tabs, resizing windows, and otherwise making things convenient for the user.
* **Bash** is a particular shell that is usually the default on Unix-based systems (such as Linux, macOS, Android, and many others). _Note:_ macOS just switched to zsh as its default shell. It shouldn't make too much difference for our work this week.
* **Unix** is a type of operating system that follows certain conventions. It used to mean something different, but these days people usually use it to mean "an operating system that works with Bash"! 
    * Pretty much every operating system you use is Unix-based, with the exception of Windows--but even Windows is making it easier than ever to use Bash. 
        
    
## Why should a data analyst learn the shell?

* The shell is the most general toolbox in the computing world. Concepts from the shell pop up everywhere in computing.
* The shell lets you interact with servers exactly the same way you interact with your laptop.
* The shell allows you to solve a lot of common problems very quickly, without learning how to do it in a more complex language and without waiting on an IT person.
* Analytics trends come and go, but Bash is forever! People have been using it for almost 50 years and it's only getting more popular.

# First shell commands

* Windows users: open Git Bash. If you don't have it yet, [install git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
* Mac users: open the Terminal program.

You should see something that looks like

```{bash}
lewis@mylaptop:~$
```

This is the prompt. The `$` at the end means that Bash will run whatever you type in next.

```{bash}
lewis@mylaptop:~$ pwd
/home/lewis
```


```{bash}
lewis@mylaptop:~$ date
Mon Aug 24 13:32:22 BST 2020
```

_Note:_ I'll mostly omit the stuff before the `$` in the prompt from here on out just to keep things tidy. Your prompt will have more stuff in it.

# Get the exercise data

```{bash}
$ curl -Lo data-shell.zip bit.ly/data-shell-zip
$ unzip data-shell.zip
$ cd data-shell
```

# Anatomy of a shell command

![From https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial](https://softcover.s3.amazonaws.com/636/learn_enough_command_line/images/figures/anatomy.png "Anatomy of a shell command")

**Prompt**: All the stuff up to the `$` is the prompt. This usually tells you your username, the computer you're connected to, and the directory you're in. (Other shells might display different information, or the same information differently.)

If you haven't terminated a command properly, the prompt will change to let you know it's expecting more input:

```{bash}
$ echo 'hello world        ## the quote here is not closed!
>
```

**Command**: The command is a program that is called by the shell. When you type in a command, the shell looks in a list of directories called the `PATH` to find an executable that matches the name of the command you typed in. You can see where the shell is finding a program with the command `which`:

```{bash}
$ which cat
/bin/cat
```

**Options** change what the command does. Note they usually come **before** the argument. They can sometimes be written in two different ways:
* Two dashes, then the full name of the option: `rm --force`
* One dash, then a single letter: `rm -f`
These two are equivalent.

**Arguments**: A command can have zero, one, or many arguments. It all depends on the command and what you want it to do.


# Some basic commands

* `pwd`: print working directory
* `ls`: list contents of the current directory. This one accepts lots of options!

    ```{bash}
    $ ls
    data-shell  data-shell-zip
    ```

    ```{bash}
    $ ls -a
    .  ..  .bash_history  .bash_logout  .bashrc  .cache  .config  .profile  data-shell  data-shell-zip
    ```
* `echo`: prints text to standard output
    ```{bash}
    $ echo 'hello world'
    hello world
    ```
* `cd`: change directory
    ```{bash}
    lewis@mylaptop:~$ pwd
    /home/lewis
    lewis@mylaptop:~$ cd data-shell
    lewis@mylaptop:~/data-shell$
    ```
* `cp`, `mv`: copies or moves a file or folder
* `cat`: short for "concatenate." Prints the contents of a file to standard output
```{bash}
$ cat notes.txt
- finish experiments
- write thesis
- get post-doc position (pref. with Dr. Horrible)
```
* `head`, `tail`: prints the first or last lines of a file. Incredibly useful for huge text files!
```{bash}
$ head -3 creatures/basilisk.dat
COMMON NAME: basilisk
CLASSIFICATION: basiliscus vulgaris
UPDATED: 1745-05-02
```

# Some special stuff

### Special characters

* `~`: your home directory
* `.`: the directory you're currently in
* `..`: one directory up from the one you're currently in
* `/`: directory separator. If it's the **first** character in a path, it means it's an absolute path; otherwise the path is relative.
* `\`: escape character. Use when you want Bash to interpret a character literally.
```{bash}
$ ls My Documents          ## Bash thinks you're listing two separate things
ls: cannot access 'My': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'Documents': No such file or directory
$ ls My\ Documents
'My Music'  'My Pictures'  'My Videos'
```

### The `Ctrl` key and copy/pasting

* `Ctrl+C`: cancels the current line of input, or the currently running process if something is running, and gives you a fresh prompt. **`Ctrl+C` does not copy in a terminal!**
* Git Bash users: Right-click the title bar -> Options -> Keys -> Check "Ctrl+Shift+Letter Shortcuts"
    * You can now use `Ctrl+Shift+C` and `Ctrl+Shift+V`
* Other terminal users: highlight text and right-click to copy, then right-click again to paste

### Bonus: How to type faster with shortcuts

A lot of this works outside the terminal!

* `Tab` completion
* Double-tap `Tab` to see options
* `↑` and `↓` to go through your command history
* `Ctrl + ←/→` to skip words
* `Alt + Backspace` to delete words
* `Ctrl + A`, `Ctrl + E` to go to beginning/end of line
* `Ctrl + R` to search history


Try typing `whoami` or `hostname`, and note how they show up in the prompt.
