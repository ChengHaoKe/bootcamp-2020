# The Tidyverse

>- “System of packages for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization that share a common design philosophy” - Rickert
>- Mainly developed by Hadley Wickham 
>- These packages work together using consistent language structures—once you learn it, these packages will feel as one

## Tidyverse packages 

![packages included in the tidyverse, always adding new packages](figures/tidyverse universe.png)

## What is Tidy Data?

>- "Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way" - Leo Tolstoy 
>- "Tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way" - Hadley Wickham
>- Basically, tidy data are the way your data should be organized 

## Three rules for tidy data:

1. Each variable must have its own column.
2. Each observation must have its own row.
3. Each value must have its own cell. 

## 1. Each variable must have its own column 

![variables to column](figures/variables to column.png)

## 2. Each observation must have its own row

![observations to row](figures/observations to row.png)

## 3. Each value must have its own cell. 

![values to cell](figures/values to cell.png)

## Load `tidyverse`

```{r load tidyverse}
library(tidyverse)
```

## `dplyr` verbs

- `select` --> subset variables
- `filter` --> subset observations based on conditions
- `mutate` --> add new variables
- `transmute` --> add new variables and drop existing ones
- `summarize` --> reduce multiple observations to a single value (e.g., find the mean)

## Trying out `dplyr` verbs - `select`

- select by name: 
  - `select(gapminder, continent, pop)`
- select by position: 
  - `select(df, c(1, 3, 10))`
- select by range:
  - `select(df, country:pop)` or `select(df, 1:3)`
- drop variables with `-`
  - `select(df, -gdpPercap)`

## Load generator data

```{r importing}
#library(readr)
#library(lubridate)

gapminder <- read_csv("../data/gapminder5.csv")

```

## Trying out `dplyr` verbs - `select`
```{r select}
select(gapminder, country, year, lifeExp)
```

## select helpers

- There are several "select helpers" that make subsetting variables very easy
  - `one_of()`, `contains()`, `starts_with()`, `ends_with()`, `matches()`

```{r}
select(gapminder, ends_with("p"), contains("ear"))
```

## `filter`

```{r filter}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp > 80)
```

## multiple conditions in `filter`

```{r, eval = F}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 35 | continent != "Asia")
```


```{r multi filter, echo = F}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 35 | continent != "Asia") %>% slice(1:5)
```

```{r, eval = F}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 35 & continent != "Asia") 
```

```{r, echo = F}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 35 & continent != "Asia") %>% slice(1:5)
```

## `mutate`

- `mutate` creates new variables

```{r mutate}
tmp <- mutate(gapminder, log_pop = log(pop))
head(tmp)
```

## `mutate`

```{r multi mutate}
tmp <- mutate(gapminder, 
              log_pop = log(pop),
              gdp_total = pop * gdpPercap)
head(tmp)
```

## `summarize`

`summarize` reduces observations to a single value based on functions
  - `mean`, `sum`, `sd`, `min`, `max`, etc.

```{r summarize}
# mean energy consumption
summarize(gapminder, mean_le = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T))

```
## `group_by`

```{r, eval = F}
group_by(gapminder, country)
```

```{r, echo = F}
group_by(gapminder, country) %>% slice(1:3)
```

```{r, eval = F}
gapgroup <- group_by(gapminder, country)
temp <- summarize(gapgroup, mean_le = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T))
head(temp)
```

```{r, echo = F}
gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(mean_le = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T))
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

- The powerful `%>%` operator lets you chain together functions
- It sends the result of one function to another function
- Read `%>%` as "then"
- `%>%` increases the readability of your code
- Don't chain more than ~10 lines of code

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

It looks like this!

```{r introducing the pipe}
# take df then filter it then select these variables
# you do not need to repeat the name of the dataframe!
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-pop) %>% 
  mutate(log_gdp = log(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(mean_le = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T))
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

```{r introducing the pipe step 1}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia")
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

```{r introducing the pipe step 2}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-pop)
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

```{r introducing the pipe step 3}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-pop) %>% 
  mutate(log_gdp = log(gdpPercap))
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

```{r introducing the pipe step 4}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-pop) %>% 
  mutate(log_gdp = log(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  group_by(country) 
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

```{r}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-pop) %>% 
  mutate(log_gdp = log(gdpPercap)) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(mean_le = mean(lifeExp, na.rm = T))
```

## A new operator: the pipe `%>%`

- While piping, the piped dataframe _is not changed_!
- You can also use pipes within a pipe

```{r dot}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-pop) %>% 
  mutate(pre_2000 = ifelse(year < 2000, "yes", "no") %>% 
           as.factor() %>% 
           factor(levels = c("yes", "no"))) 
```

## Exercise 1

- Using the gapminder data `do the following with pipes:
  1. Select variables that contain the begin with the letter "c"
  2. Find the average gdpPercap (hint: what might be the most useful way to do this?) (hint 2: use `group_by` and `summarize`)

## Solution exercise 1

```{r exercise}
gapminder %>% 
  select(contains("c")) %>% slice(1:5)

gapminder %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(mean_gdp = mean(gdpPercap, na.rm = T)) %>% slice(1:5)
```
