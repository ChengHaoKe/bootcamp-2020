# R as a calculator

```{r}
2+2
2/3
log(10)
abs(-1)
sqrt(9)
```

---
# Logical statements

.med[Common logical operators: 

  - == (is equal)
  - != (not equal)
  - < (greater than), > (less than)
  - & (and), | (or)
]

---
# Logical statements

```{r}
1 < 2

2 >= 1

1 == 2

2 != 2

1 > 0 & 2 > 0

1 < 0 | 2 <= 3
```

---
# PRACTICE 
.large[
1) Calculate square root of 109090

<br>

2) What number is larger: The log of 2000 or the square root of 51? (Try to do this in one line only)

<br>

3) What is the maximum number between: the square root of 200, seven times 2, and log of 3000 (Try to do this in one line only)

# Objects

.large[
- R is based on objects: variables, functions, dataframes, etc.

<br>
- Objects can be of different types (or "class"). The types of operations you can perform will depend on the class. 

<br>

- Most common class of objects: numeric, character, logical, matrix, data.frame, list, function.
]

---
# Objects

We usually want to store objects so we can work with them later. We do this by attributing a name to that object. 

```{r}
year <- 2020
```

What type of object is "year"?

```{r}
class(year)
```

```{r}
prof_name <- "Jean"
prof_name
class(prof_name)
```

---
# Vectors (combining objects)

A vector is a combination of more than one object (of the same class). We can create vectors with c() which stands for "combine". 

```{r}
names <- c("Jean", "Amanda", "Pilar")
names
class(names)
```
--

```{r}
grad_year <- c(2016, 2021, 2023)
grad_year
class(grad_year)
```
--

```{r}
area <- c("Methods", "American Politics", "Comparative Politics")
```

---
# PRACTICE 
.large[
1) Create an object with your first name and a second object with your last name.

<br>

2) Create a vector that contains your first and last name. (Try the function "paste" too)
]

---
# Functions to describe numeric vectors

.large[
summary()

mean()

median()

sd()

var()
]

---
# Dataframes 

.large[
  - Data frames are the core data structure in R. A data frame is a list of named vectors with the same length.
  - Data frames are *heterogenous*: the vectors in a data frames can each be of a different data type.
  - Columns are typically variables and rows are observations.
  - You can make make data frames with `data.frame()`, or by combining vectors with `cbind()` or `rbind()`.
  ]
---
# Dataframes (combining vectors)

```{r}
dataset <- cbind(names, grad_year, area)
dataset 
```

```{r}
dataset <- data.frame(names = c("Jean","Amanda","Pilar"), 
                 grad_year = c(2016, 2021, 2023), 
                 area = c("Methods", "American Politics", "Comparative Politics"))
dataset
```
---
# Dataframes

Data frames can be indexed by using variable/column names: `df$var` or `df["var"]`.

```{r}
dataset$names

dataset$grad_year[dataset$names == "Jean"]

dataset$new_grad_year <- dataset$grad_year - 2

dataset$new_grad_year
```

# Basics of R: Errors and Warnings

.med[Error: If you get an error, the command will not be executed. This can be due to many things (including silly spelling mistakes, missing parentheses, etc.)]

```{r error= TRUE}
names <- "Jean", "Amanda", "Pilar"
```

--

.med[In some occasions, R will warn you about this even before executing the code.]

```{r  out.height="90%", out.width="90%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("error.png") 
```

---
# Basics of R: Errors and Warnings

.med[If you get a warning, the command will still be executed, but with some tweaking.]

--

```{r warning=TRUE}
x <- as.numeric(c("1", "2", "X"))
```
<br>
--

.med[Make sure that "tweaking" still gets you the result you want.]

```{r}
x
```

# Where to find help 

.med[
1) In R:
 - type ?mean 
 - In "Help" window on lower-right pane


2) Google


3) StackExchange, StackOverflow


4) Package documentation, Package vignettes
]

---
# PRACTICE

.large[
1) Install the package "tidyverse" 

<br>

2) Download and save the documentation for the package
